    <h2>Background and Motivation</h2>
    <p>AI is reshaping the global economy around itself at breakneck speed. As soon-to-be new grads, we are acutely
      aware of how AI has the possibility to upend the economy and job market, replacing entry-level jobs faster than we
      are able to adapt to this new reality.</p>

    <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
    <p>We want to paint a story of this snapshot in time - before AI is generally useful in the workforce but just as it is staring to impact the job market.</p>
    <p>We want to tell this story in three parts: the risks, the opportunities, and the geographic distribution.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The risks section will focus on the jobs that are at highest risk of being replaced by AI. It will show how many jobs that were traditionally 'safe' like white-collar jobs are now at risk of being replaced by AI.</li>
      <li>The opportunities section will focus on the skills that are becoming an expectation in the workforce, in order to help individuals understand what active learning they should be doing to make themselves more attractive candidates. It will also focus on what jobs and industries have the most AI upside.</li>
      <li>The geographic distribution section will focus on the geographic distribution of AI jobs to show how it is not evenly distributed across the globe or even the US.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Dataset</h2>
    <p>We will be using the Stanford AI Index Dataset. Each year since 2017, the Stanford Human-Centered AI Institute
      releases the AI Index.</p>
    <p>The dataset contains data in many categories, but we will focus on the economic AI data. This section of the AI Index is focused on the economic impact of AI on the job market and economy. For this project, the most important datasubsets are the jov risk scores, skills demand, and geographic distribution.</p>

    <h2>Data Processing</h2>
    <p>The dataset is released each year from 2017-2025 and the amount of data collected has grown each year. </p>
    <p>The jobs data that we want to focus on is mostly collected between 2023-2025. As AI evolves so quickly, we will
      be able to show the beginning of trends with these 3 years of data rather than showing a complete picture over
      many, many years.</p>
    <p>Much of the data is already relatively clean so there will be minimal work on that end.</p>

    <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
    <p>To start the project, we did extensive EDA on the data. All of the python notebooks are in the data-exploration folder. The following were our most interesting visualizations/insights based on the data:</p>

    <h2>Must Have Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Scrolly-telling layout (see <a href="https://flourish.studio/blog/no-code-scrollytelling/"
          target="_blank">examples</a> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/pro/central-banking/data/reacting-to-fed-rates"
          target="_blank">for</a> <a href="https://graphics.wsj.com/what-ecb-qe-stimulus-has-done/"
          target="_blank">reference</a>). We will be using the Wall Street Journal's <a
          href="https://github.com/WSJ/scroll-watcher?tab=readme-ov-file" target="_blank">ScrollWatch Repo</a> to handle
        the interaction. When possible, scrolling will be the means by which users interact with data.</li>
      <li>When data will permit, we will show timebound trends of how AI has evolved the skills and types of jobs being
        hired for.</li>
      <li>Map visualization</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Nice to Have Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Map Zoom is going from a global view to zoom into countries or continents, then to zoom into cities, showing
        AI jobs and AI economic growth with a key visual (maybe as the person scrolls through the storytelling).</li>
      <li>Ghost traces to show past years' data on the current trends with hover features that allow the examination of
        older data to contrast the 2025 report.</li>
      <li>Some sort of predictive feature that shows calculations based on current trajectories.</li>
      <li>Users will be able to input their career title to see have that highlighted automatically in relevant secitons of the visualizations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Design Evolution</h2>
    <p> <b>Checkpoint 1:</b> So far, we have an article with visualizations that are not interactive on scroll. All of our content and visualizations are worked out, but they are just in a continuous HTML file. Some have some hover features, but no scrollability. In class, we've discussed how motion is a key principle of storytelling for data, and we have a plan for how to implmeent that motion into our porject. While the design of the visualizations might not change much from here, implementing the scrollability will be a major change to the project and the layout of the site. We're excited to see where this goes! </p>

    <p> <b>Checkpoint 2:</b> We had a lot of design changes in this round! First, we implemented the sticky scrolling so that text and visualizations would appear in a 2-column layout. From there, we each took our try at making our visualizations change with the scrolling. This was pretty hard but we're happy with where it landed. The biggest noticeable change was the design system. We changed the primary background color to dark mode with contrasting white text, updated the fonts, and the text hierarchy. Finally, we changed the colors for the visualizations – we originally had green and red but changed to blue and red as to be more accessible for red-green color blindness. We also refined the spacing and scroll distances to create a more compact, focused reading experience so each section is not too long.</p>
