    <h2>Background and Motivation</h2>
    <p>AI is reshaping the global economy around itself at breakneck speed. As soon-to-be new grads, we are acutely
      aware of how AI has the possibility to upend the economy and job market, replacing entry-level jobs faster than we
      are able to adapt to this new reality.</p>

    <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
    <p>We aim to give users a holistic view into how AI is changing the job market and economy for job-seekers.</p>
    <p>We aim to provide insight into what AI skills are becoming an expectation in the workforce, in order to help
      individuals understand what active learning they should be doing to make themselves more attractive candidates.
    </p>
    <p>We aim to provide insight on different scales (global, country) on where AI is growing and how it is impacting
      the surrounding areas in terms of job availability.</p>
    <p>We aim to tell a story on how AI has grown in the last year.</p>
    <p>What does it mean to be looking for a job in the AI Era? Tell that story.</p>

    <h2>Dataset</h2>
    <p>We will be using the Stanford AI Index Dataset. Each year since 2017, the Stanford Human-Centered AI Institute
      releases the AI Index.</p>

    <h2>Data Processing</h2>
    <p>The dataset is released each year from 2017-2025 and the amount of data collected has grown each year. Our main
      processing task will be to synthesize the entire dataset (currently separated by years and not time-series) into
      time-series data to show how AI trends have shifted over the last 8 years.</p>
    <p>The jobs data that we want to focus on is mostly collected between 2023-2025. As AI evolves so quickly, we will
      be able to show the beginning of trends with these 3 years of data rather than showing a complete picture over
      many, many years.</p>
    <p>Much of the data is already relatively clean so there will be minimal work on that end.</p>

    <h2>Designs</h2>
    <p>Sketches go here.</p>

    <h2>Must Have Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Scrolly-telling layout (see <a href="https://flourish.studio/blog/no-code-scrollytelling/"
          target="_blank">examples</a> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/pro/central-banking/data/reacting-to-fed-rates"
          target="_blank">for</a> <a href="https://graphics.wsj.com/what-ecb-qe-stimulus-has-done/"
          target="_blank">reference</a>). We will be using the Wall Street Journal's <a
          href="https://github.com/WSJ/scroll-watcher?tab=readme-ov-file" target="_blank">ScrollWatch Repo</a> to handle
        the interaction. When possible, scrolling will be the means by which users interact with data.</li>
      <li>When data will permit, we will show timebound trends of how AI has evolved the skills and types of jobs being
        hired for.</li>
      <li>Map visualization</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Nice to Have Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Map Zoom is going from a global view to zoom into countries or continents, then to zoom into cities, showing
        AI jobs and AI economic growth with a key visual (maybe as the person scrolls through the storytelling).</li>
      <li>Ghost traces to show past years' data on the current trends with hover features that allow the examination of
        older data to contrast the 2025 report.</li>
      <li>Some sort of predictive feature that shows calculations based on current trajectories.</li>
    </ul>
